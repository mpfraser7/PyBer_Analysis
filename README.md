# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to visually display the total fare by city type, between January 1st to April 28 of the year 2019.


## Results

Here's the resulting line chart:

It's very apparent that the higher density city types have a higher total fare. 

Here's the resulting summary dataframe, showing totals and averages:

## Summary
Based on the results, I would make three recommendations to the CEO:

-Although the Urban type has a much higher total fare, the average per driver is much lower than the other two types. I would recommend looking into charging a premium for rides in Urban cities. The average fare per ride in Urban is also lower than the other two.
-Without distance data, such as total kilometers and average kilometers per ride, it is difficult to come up with actionable insights. I would recommend to look into adding more data points in the data set.
-There are more drivers than rides in Urban cities. I would recommend doing further analysis by city to find out if there are any outliers.
